This repository contains the source code of original ThaiFixes 2.0 source code, for archival and educational purpose only.

The source code comes from `thaifixes_1.7.10_x_src.rar`, which also hosted on my website.

## History

It's 2014. There was more and more people using MinecraftForge, and I was stuck on the old way of installing mods.
With a little help from [secretdataz](https://github.com/secretdataz), I was successfully converted ThaiFixes functionality
from a vanilla mod to a MinecraftForge mod.

## Building

You need to build modified game source code (`FontRenderer.java`) with Minecraft Coder Pack first, and then you just build others normally.
To get a final product, you just combine two seperated build into one jar.

To be fair, This code is older than 3 years, so don't expect me to answer anything useful, but yeah, you can ask me by the way.

## License
